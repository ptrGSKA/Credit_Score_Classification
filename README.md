# Credit_Score_Classification

A credit classification model is a tool that is typically used in the decision-making process of determining ones credit score.  
The classification model is the result of a statistical model which, based on information about the borrower (e.g. Monthly Income, Number of Bank accounts/Credit cards, Outstanding debt etc.),   
allows one to distinguish between "good", "standard" and "bad" credit.   
A robust and accurate model can help to predict an individual credibility and eligibility for loans and other financial serives.

The goal is to build a multi -class classification model capable of accurately predict credit score categories.
